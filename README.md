# Spring-Security-Login-Template-W-Front-End

# About

Hi! Thanks for checking out this project. You can use this as a template to begin your projects. 

You get a fully working back-end and front-end application which allows you to register your user and and then sign-in using those credentials. You get back a JWT which is then stored in your Browser storage for you to use in other API calls

# Note

- You will have to create a databse. The database info stored in the back end is:
  - DB name: spring_db
  - Username: root
  - password: root
  
- Make sure to check application.properties and enter your database credentials if they are different from above.

- Make sure to check the SecurityConfiguration.java file in the com.cognixia.jump.config package. Her eyou will find the authorization settings in the filterChain() method. Read the comments for each method and feel free to play around.

- Make sure to add a star to let me know you were here :)
